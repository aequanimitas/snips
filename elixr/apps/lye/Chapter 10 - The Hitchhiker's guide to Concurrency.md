**Erlang is about writing highly available systems, systems that run forever
and are always able to meaningfully respond to clients**

## Erlang Worldview
- Everything is a process.
- Processes are strongly isolated.
- Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.
- Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.
- Processes can have unique names.
- If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.
- Processes share no resources.
- Error handling is non-local.
- Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.

## Challenges
- minimize, isolate and recover from the effects of runtime errors (fault tolerance)
- handle load increase by adding more hardware without changing or
  redeploying the code (scalability)
- run the system in multiple machines so that others can take over if one
  fails (distribution)

**BEAM == Erlang VM**

## Concurrency and Parallelism

Both means processes running independently, the difference is in concurrency, 
they donâ€™t all run necessarily at the same time, while parallelism means running 
all at the same time

- Two concurrent things == Two execution contexts, parallel processing doesn't
  happen automatically, it all depends on the number of cores.
- Single core == no parallel execution
- Concurrency by itself doesn't speed things up
- Process creation is the mechanism to run something concurrently. After execution,
  the memory is released
- When data is passed from one process to another, it is deep-copied since
  both processed can't share memory
- processes' order of execution is not guaranteed

## Scalability
- Users/Processes only react when a specific event happens 
- Processes only doing small computations, switching between them as events came 
  through
- For efficiency reasons, processes needs to be started and stopped very quickly
  (receiving call, hanging up)
- No process pools, programs use as much process as they need
- Sharing memory is forbidden and unreliable, inconsistent state. Processes 
  should communicate by sending messages where all the data is copied. Slower 
  but safer

#### NOTE
Bypassing hardware limitations:
- make the hardware better
- add more hardware

## Fault Tolerance
There is no 100%. Let it crash, find good ways to handle it rather than trying 
to prevent them all. Systems can either have clean shutdowns and crashes 
(termination with unexpected error). 

Faulty components should be automatically terminated when errors that corrupt
data arise

### Clean shutdown *(read more on the strategies below)*
- single assignment 
- shared-nothing 
- avoiding locks - locks leaves other processes from accessing data or leaving
  it in an inconsistent state

Erlang's solution is to make processes killed quickly to avoid data corruption
and transient *(means lasting only a short time)* bugs. See 3rd bullet point in
scalability. 

Async message passing
- no sense in checking if other process received the message, you just send it
  with having no guarantees in mind if the receiving proc is still alive

## Concurrency Implementation
- Schedulers
  - one thread per core
  - has a run queue, list of erlang processes
  - if a queue has too much processes, it is then migrated to another queue
  - Erlang VM takes care of load balancing
- ring benchmark, remember erlang exercises on concurrency, even there's only
  one process that does something useful, the VM still spends time distributing
  the load across schedulers / cores.

**A process is a function that runs a function and once it's finished, it disappears**

SMP - Symmetrical Multi Processor

- Process mailbox messages are kept in the order they are received

```receive``` and ```case``` looks the same, the only the difference is that in
```case```, the variable binds in the expression after ```case``` while in
```receive``` the variable binds in the messages received

on the ```Dolphin``` example, after the spawned process receives the message, it
is immediately killed. Do a test, send a message again to the process and it's
only reply is an ```:ok``` atom, maybe this means the message was sent

on ```dolphin3/0```, recursion is used to bypass creating new processes

```receive``` is like a "IO blocking" mechanism

- Synchronous sending: cooperation between two processes by using the basic
  async capabilities of Elixir/Erlang
- ```self()``` == PID of calling process (function, shell, etc.)
- sending a message to process that is doing some sort of heavy computation is
  not going to stop its activity, the message will be pushed at the tail of
  it message stack / mailbox
